# Kodi Plugin
In this folder you'll find the python source code to create a plugin for the kodi media center that allows you to use the JSON files generated by the tool to access those video listed in the Kodi media center.

You'll need to make a couple of edits in 'Default.py' before you can use it, namely you'll need to tell the plugin the webserver location it can access the JSON files from, open the python file up and read the comments, it's fairly self explanitory.

Once modified you need to zip the folder (Making shure that 'plugin.video.channel9' appears as the top and only item in the zip file), then copy that zip to your kodi media center, or to a location your media center can access it.

After it's copied, you will need to go into your Kodi settings and set things so that you can install un-official plugins from 3rd party services, then from your plug in manager settings, add a plugin from a zip file and browse to where you saved the zip on your media center.
